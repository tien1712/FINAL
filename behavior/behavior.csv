10350125,"That person uses Public transports if: the journey is direct without requiring any changes and the route information is very clear, as they are unfamiliar with the network. Use Private modes if: the trip demands flexibility in destination and timing and a predictable arrival is crucial. Use Soft modes if: the distance is short, allowing them to avoid the significant annoyances of traffic and parking. A significant consideration is their strong aversion to both traffic congestion and searching for parking, which conflicts with their view of the car as the most flexible and punctual option; despite being open to public transit's social benefits, their unfamiliarity with the system and dislike for transfers make them feel they have no other viable alternative for most trips."
10350199,"That person uses Public transports if: their primary vehicle is unavailable or for simple, direct routes where traffic congestion is a known and significant problem, Use Private modes if: flexibility in destination and timing is paramount, as they believe it is the only option that allows them to complete all their desired activities, Use Soft modes if: the trip is for very short, non-essential purposes where convenience and time are not factors. A primary consideration is their conviction that a private car offers complete freedom to travel, while public transport is so restrictive it would force them to cancel activities; however, they strongly disagree with feeling uncomfortable around strangers, indicating their barriers to shared transport are practical rather than social."
10360009,"That person uses Public transports if: their primary mode is unavailable and the journey is long and direct, allowing them to use the time productively, Use Private modes if: they require the flexibility to go anywhere at any time or believe other options would limit their range of activities, Use Soft modes if: the trip is for a very short distance where driving would be less convenient. This person is a highly habitual traveler who feels locked into their usual mode of transport, primarily because they believe it offers unparalleled freedom to go wherever and whenever they want. They are not motivated by the potential community benefits of using public transit, but a significant exception is their strong desire to use travel time productively, which could sway their decision if their primary mode is not an option."
10360011,"That person uses Public transports if: the journey is direct without requiring transfers and the destination is known for heavy traffic and difficult parking, Use Private modes if: it is their habitual choice for activities, offering the flexibility to go anywhere at any time, which they feel is necessary to avoid canceling activities, Use Soft modes if: the distance is very short, making the frustration of potential traffic and parking hassles greater than the convenience of driving. A significant consideration is that this person feels they have no real alternative to their current mode of transport, a choice reinforced by a strong dislike for being stuck in traffic and a preference for single-mode journeys."
10360023,"That person uses Public transports if: the journey is simple, the schedule is clear, and avoiding traffic is the main priority, Use Private modes if: the trip requires maximum flexibility in destination or timing and is perceived as the only viable option, Use Soft modes if: the distance is very short and the destination is in a congested area where driving would be inconvenient. This person's choice is overwhelmingly driven by the strong belief that they have no alternative to their current mode and that a car provides unparalleled freedom of movement; a major deterrent from using public transport is the difficulty they have understanding the schedules, even though they are comfortable with factors like traveling with strangers or making transfers."
10360113,"That person uses Public transports if: the journey is direct without any transfers and does not limit their planned activities, Use Private modes if: the trip requires flexibility in destination or timing and they perceive it as the only viable option, Use Soft modes if: the destination is nearby, which allows for a simple journey that avoids traffic. A key consideration is that this person feels they have no alternative to their usual mode of transport and strongly dislikes changing modes during a trip, viewing public transport as overly restrictive to their activities. This reliance exists even though they agree that being stuck in traffic is boring and disagree that using a car ensures they will be on time."
10360139,"That person uses Public transports if: their private vehicle is unavailable and the destination is inaccessible by soft modes, Use Private modes if: they need to maintain flexibility for their activities and travel directly to their destination without transfers, Use Soft modes if: the trip is very short, direct, and the difficulty of finding parking at the destination outweighs the convenience of driving. A key consideration for this individual is their strong belief that they have no real alternative to their current mode, viewing the car as essential for freedom and enabling their activities. This choice is deeply ingrained, as they do not reconsider their travel habits and perceive public transportation as overly restrictive and its schedules as difficult to understand."
10360159,"That person uses Public transports if: driving is made impossible by factors like guaranteed severe traffic and a very simple, direct public transport alternative is known. Use Private modes if: it is their ingrained, habitual choice for nearly all journeys, driven by a strong feeling that no other real alternatives exist. Use Soft modes if: the destination is extremely close and the route is simple, making a car trip obviously impractical. A key consideration for this person is that they are a creature of habit who feels they have no alternative to their usual mode, which creates a conflict with their strong dislike of being stuck in traffic; this resistance to change is reinforced by their belief that public transport schedules are too difficult to understand."
10360162,"That person uses Public transports if: the journey is on a familiar route and they are motivated by the strong belief that it makes the city more welcoming, Use Private modes if: being on time is the most critical factor, as they are highly confident in the car's reliability, Use Soft modes if: the trip is for leisure or to connect different parts of a longer journey, taking advantage of their willingness to change transport modes. A key consideration for this person is the conflict between their strong belief that the car is essential for punctuality and their positive social attitude towards buses; uniquely, they are not deterred by common travel hassles like looking for a parking space or changing their mode of transport mid-trip."
10360193,"That person uses Public transports if: the destination is well-served by a direct route and the journey allows for productive use of travel time, especially when the alternative involves driving in traffic. Use Private modes if: the trip requires absolute flexibility in destination or timing, or involves activities that would otherwise have to be cancelled. Use Soft modes if: the distance is very short and the journey is for a simple, direct trip. The decision is overwhelmingly driven by the need for flexibility; they strongly believe a private vehicle allows them to go anywhere at any time and that public transport would force them to cancel activities, even though they value using travel time productively and dislike being stuck in traffic."
10360195,"That person uses Public transports if: they feel they have no other option or for specific routes where traffic is a known problem and the public transport service is straightforward and does not restrict their activities. Use Private modes if: flexibility and guaranteed punctuality are essential, as this is their default, habitual choice for most activities. Use Soft modes if: the journey is very short and for a recreational or non-essential purpose where time is not a factor. A primary consideration for this person is their strong belief that a car provides the ultimate freedom to go wherever and whenever they want, a conviction that makes it their default choice even though they dislike being stuck in traffic."
10360212,"That person uses Public transports if: their usual mode is unavailable and the journey is direct without any transfers, allowing them to use the travel time productively, Use Private modes if: it is their established routine for that specific activity, especially when they need flexibility in timing and destination, Use Soft modes if: the destination is very close, making driving and parking more of a hassle than the short journey itself. This person is a highly habitual traveler who feels locked into their current transportation choices and does not reconsider them; a primary consideration is their strong aversion to hassles like being stuck in traffic, looking for parking, and especially changing modes of transport mid-journey. While they strongly desire to use their travel time productively, their profound lack of knowledge about public transport routes and a belief that schedules are hard to understand creates a significant barrier to using it."
10360225,"That person uses Public transports if: the destination is well-served by a route they know well, travel time is predictable, and avoiding traffic is a priority, Use Private modes if: the trip requires a high degree of flexibility in destination or timing that public transport cannot offer, Use Soft modes if: the journey is short and a direct door-to-door trip is needed, completely avoiding the hassles of traffic and parking. A key consideration for this person is the conflict between the absolute freedom a car provides to go anywhere at any time, which they strongly value, and their intense dislike for being stuck in traffic and searching for parking; they also strongly prefer direct journeys without transfers, which can make public transport less appealing."
10360285,"That person uses Public transports if: their destination is easily and directly accessible by a single route and the journey does not involve other activities that require flexibility. Use Private modes if: their travel involves complex itineraries or multiple destinations, as they strongly believe it is the only way to avoid canceling their plans. Use Soft modes if: the trip is short and routine, allowing them to completely avoid the frustrations of traffic and searching for parking. A critical factor in their decision is the conviction that public transport limits their activities, but it's noteworthy that they are not at all uncomfortable traveling close to people they do not know, making shared modes an option when convenience allows."
10360464,"That person uses Public transports if: it is their primary and routine mode of travel, as they are an experienced lifelong user who knows the system well and perceives a lack of other viable options. Use Private modes if: it is the only available option for a specific destination not served by public transit, and they are likely a passenger rather than a driver. Use Soft modes if: the journey is short and direct, allowing them to completely avoid both traffic and the inconvenience of transfers between public transport lines. A critical factor in their decision-making is a strong aversion to being stuck in traffic and a dislike for changing modes during a trip, often leading them to prioritize a direct route over the fastest one."
10360465,"That person uses Public transports if: it is the only available option and they have no other choice for their journey, Use Private modes if: they require guaranteed punctuality and the flexibility to go anywhere without having to cancel activities, Use Soft modes if: the destination is very close and the trip is not essential or time-sensitive. A primary consideration is their strong belief that they have no alternative to their current mode of transport, creating a feeling of being a captive user. While they appreciate the freedom and punctuality of a car, they dislike traffic and are open to change; however, this is prevented by a significant lack of knowledge about public transport and the perception that it would restrict their personal activities."
