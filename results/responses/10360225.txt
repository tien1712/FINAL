That person uses Public transports if: the destination is well-served by a route they know well, travel time is predictable, and avoiding traffic is a priority, Use Private modes if: the trip requires a high degree of flexibility in destination or timing that public transport cannot offer, Use Soft modes if: the journey is short and a direct door-to-door trip is needed, completely avoiding the hassles of traffic and parking. A key consideration for this person is the conflict between the absolute freedom a car provides to go anywhere at any time, which they strongly value, and their intense dislike for being stuck in traffic and searching for parking; they also strongly prefer direct journeys without transfers, which can make public transport less appealing.
