That person uses Public transports if: their primary mode is unavailable and the journey is long and direct, allowing them to use the time productively, Use Private modes if: they require the flexibility to go anywhere at any time or believe other options would limit their range of activities, Use Soft modes if: the trip is for a very short distance where driving would be less convenient. This person is a highly habitual traveler who feels locked into their usual mode of transport, primarily because they believe it offers unparalleled freedom to go wherever and whenever they want. They are not motivated by the potential community benefits of using public transit, but a significant exception is their strong desire to use travel time productively, which could sway their decision if their primary mode is not an option.
