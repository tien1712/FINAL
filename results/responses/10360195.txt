That person uses Public transports if: they feel they have no other option or for specific routes where traffic is a known problem and the public transport service is straightforward and does not restrict their activities. Use Private modes if: flexibility and guaranteed punctuality are essential, as this is their default, habitual choice for most activities. Use Soft modes if: the journey is very short and for a recreational or non-essential purpose where time is not a factor. A primary consideration for this person is their strong belief that a car provides the ultimate freedom to go wherever and whenever they want, a conviction that makes it their default choice even though they dislike being stuck in traffic.
