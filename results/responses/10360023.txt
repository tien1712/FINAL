That person uses Public transports if: the journey is simple, the schedule is clear, and avoiding traffic is the main priority, Use Private modes if: the trip requires maximum flexibility in destination or timing and is perceived as the only viable option, Use Soft modes if: the distance is very short and the destination is in a congested area where driving would be inconvenient. This person's choice is overwhelmingly driven by the strong belief that they have no alternative to their current mode and that a car provides unparalleled freedom of movement; a major deterrent from using public transport is the difficulty they have understanding the schedules, even though they are comfortable with factors like traveling with strangers or making transfers.
