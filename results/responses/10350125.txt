That person uses Public transports if: the journey is direct without requiring any changes and the route information is very clear, as they are unfamiliar with the network. Use Private modes if: the trip demands flexibility in destination and timing and a predictable arrival is crucial. Use Soft modes if: the distance is short, allowing them to avoid the significant annoyances of traffic and parking. A significant consideration is their strong aversion to both traffic congestion and searching for parking, which conflicts with their view of the car as the most flexible and punctual option; despite being open to public transit's social benefits, their unfamiliarity with the system and dislike for transfers make them feel they have no other viable alternative for most trips.
