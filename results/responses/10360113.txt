That person uses Public transports if: the journey is direct without any transfers and does not limit their planned activities, Use Private modes if: the trip requires flexibility in destination or timing and they perceive it as the only viable option, Use Soft modes if: the destination is nearby, which allows for a simple journey that avoids traffic. A key consideration is that this person feels they have no alternative to their usual mode of transport and strongly dislikes changing modes during a trip, viewing public transport as overly restrictive to their activities. This reliance exists even though they agree that being stuck in traffic is boring and disagree that using a car ensures they will be on time.
