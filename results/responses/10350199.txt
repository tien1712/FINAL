That person uses Public transports if: their primary vehicle is unavailable or for simple, direct routes where traffic congestion is a known and significant problem, Use Private modes if: flexibility in destination and timing is paramount, as they believe it is the only option that allows them to complete all their desired activities, Use Soft modes if: the trip is for very short, non-essential purposes where convenience and time are not factors. A primary consideration is their conviction that a private car offers complete freedom to travel, while public transport is so restrictive it would force them to cancel activities; however, they strongly disagree with feeling uncomfortable around strangers, indicating their barriers to shared transport are practical rather than social.
