That person uses Public transports if: the journey is direct without requiring transfers and the destination is known for heavy traffic and difficult parking, Use Private modes if: it is their habitual choice for activities, offering the flexibility to go anywhere at any time, which they feel is necessary to avoid canceling activities, Use Soft modes if: the distance is very short, making the frustration of potential traffic and parking hassles greater than the convenience of driving. A significant consideration is that this person feels they have no real alternative to their current mode of transport, a choice reinforced by a strong dislike for being stuck in traffic and a preference for single-mode journeys.
