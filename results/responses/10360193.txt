That person uses Public transports if: the destination is well-served by a direct route and the journey allows for productive use of travel time, especially when the alternative involves driving in traffic. Use Private modes if: the trip requires absolute flexibility in destination or timing, or involves activities that would otherwise have to be cancelled. Use Soft modes if: the distance is very short and the journey is for a simple, direct trip. The decision is overwhelmingly driven by the need for flexibility; they strongly believe a private vehicle allows them to go anywhere at any time and that public transport would force them to cancel activities, even though they value using travel time productively and dislike being stuck in traffic.
