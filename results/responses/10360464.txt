That person uses Public transports if: it is their primary and routine mode of travel, as they are an experienced lifelong user who knows the system well and perceives a lack of other viable options. Use Private modes if: it is the only available option for a specific destination not served by public transit, and they are likely a passenger rather than a driver. Use Soft modes if: the journey is short and direct, allowing them to completely avoid both traffic and the inconvenience of transfers between public transport lines. A critical factor in their decision-making is a strong aversion to being stuck in traffic and a dislike for changing modes during a trip, often leading them to prioritize a direct route over the fastest one.
