That person uses Public transports if: their destination is easily and directly accessible by a single route and the journey does not involve other activities that require flexibility. Use Private modes if: their travel involves complex itineraries or multiple destinations, as they strongly believe it is the only way to avoid canceling their plans. Use Soft modes if: the trip is short and routine, allowing them to completely avoid the frustrations of traffic and searching for parking. A critical factor in their decision is the conviction that public transport limits their activities, but it's noteworthy that they are not at all uncomfortable traveling close to people they do not know, making shared modes an option when convenience allows.
