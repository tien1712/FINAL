That person uses Public transports if: the journey is on a familiar route and they are motivated by the strong belief that it makes the city more welcoming, Use Private modes if: being on time is the most critical factor, as they are highly confident in the car's reliability, Use Soft modes if: the trip is for leisure or to connect different parts of a longer journey, taking advantage of their willingness to change transport modes. A key consideration for this person is the conflict between their strong belief that the car is essential for punctuality and their positive social attitude towards buses; uniquely, they are not deterred by common travel hassles like looking for a parking space or changing their mode of transport mid-trip.
