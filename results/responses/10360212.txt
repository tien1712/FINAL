That person uses Public transports if: their usual mode is unavailable and the journey is direct without any transfers, allowing them to use the travel time productively, Use Private modes if: it is their established routine for that specific activity, especially when they need flexibility in timing and destination, Use Soft modes if: the destination is very close, making driving and parking more of a hassle than the short journey itself. This person is a highly habitual traveler who feels locked into their current transportation choices and does not reconsider them; a primary consideration is their strong aversion to hassles like being stuck in traffic, looking for parking, and especially changing modes of transport mid-journey. While they strongly desire to use their travel time productively, their profound lack of knowledge about public transport routes and a belief that schedules are hard to understand creates a significant barrier to using it.
