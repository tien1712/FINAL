That person uses Public transports if: driving is made impossible by factors like guaranteed severe traffic and a very simple, direct public transport alternative is known. Use Private modes if: it is their ingrained, habitual choice for nearly all journeys, driven by a strong feeling that no other real alternatives exist. Use Soft modes if: the destination is extremely close and the route is simple, making a car trip obviously impractical. A key consideration for this person is that they are a creature of habit who feels they have no alternative to their usual mode, which creates a conflict with their strong dislike of being stuck in traffic; this resistance to change is reinforced by their belief that public transport schedules are too difficult to understand.
