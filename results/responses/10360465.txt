That person uses Public transports if: it is the only available option and they have no other choice for their journey, Use Private modes if: they require guaranteed punctuality and the flexibility to go anywhere without having to cancel activities, Use Soft modes if: the destination is very close and the trip is not essential or time-sensitive. A primary consideration is their strong belief that they have no alternative to their current mode of transport, creating a feeling of being a captive user. While they appreciate the freedom and punctuality of a car, they dislike traffic and are open to change; however, this is prevented by a significant lack of knowledge about public transport and the perception that it would restrict their personal activities.
